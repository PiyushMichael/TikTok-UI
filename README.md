TikTok-UI is a UI only demonstration app made on **React Native**. No image assets have been used to render UI elements, all elements have been achieved programmatically using *gradients, transformations and react-native-vector-icons*. I've also experimented with shadows and translucent backgrounds/gradients to improve text legibility . Pure function components were used in this app. Feel free to go through the code or download the APK.
